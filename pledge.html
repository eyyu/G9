		<h2>Hi F.I.V.E. movement to eliminate stigma</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Hi F.I.V.E.</strong>  campaign aims to <strong>eliminate</strong> stigma towards those who are experiencing mental health distress or illness (now or in the past).  We invite everybody in our campus communities to join us in taking this pledge and respect and embrace anyone experiencing mental health distress or mental illness.</p>
        <p><strong>Hi F.I.V.E. SPACES</strong> provide safe places for those who struggle and or experience mental health distress to seek support and friendship.</p>
        <p><strong>PLEDGE</strong>:  I am committed to the following regarding those who experience or have experienced mental illness or mental health distress including myself:</p>
        <p>
        <ol type="hyphen">
			<li>I am committed to <strong>embracing</strong> and respecting those experiencing mental health distress and mental illness.</li>
			<li>I am committed to <strong>standing up (and speaking up)</strong> when disrespect is shown against those experiencing mental health 
                distress and mental illness.</li>
			<li>I am committed to <strong>making a difference</strong> and promoting wellness in the lives of those experiencing mental health distress and mental illness. </li>
			<li>I am committed to conducting myself and my endeavours in a manner that is <strong>respectful</strong> of those who experience mental
                health distress and mental illness.</li>
			<li>I pledge to know the facts, to being aware of my attitudes and behaviours, and to speaking and acting respectfully when discussing 
                or speaking to those with mental health distress and mental illness.</li>
            <li>I am committed to <strong>suspending judgments</strong> against people who experience mental health distress and mental illness.</li>
            <li>I am committed <strong>welcoming friendships</strong> and/or relationships with those experiencing mental health distress and mental illness.</li>
            <li>I am committed <strong>to not treating people</strong> who experience mental health distress and mental illness as if all they are is their diagnosis.</li>
