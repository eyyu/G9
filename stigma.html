            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>We currently live in a world shrouded with isolation.  
                Technology separates us from having face to face conversations, and this means much of our daily interactions are limited.  
                We end up missing out on the many opportunities to share our stories, feelings, and thoughts with our peers.
                </p>
            
            <p>
                As students, our mental health can be affected by stress, emotional pain, and common struggles like depression, anxiety
                and grief. But we don't have to go through it alone. A diary is typically known to be an outlet for our most personal stories. 
                Use the diaries we are providing to share yours.  Tell us how you feel or how you have been impacted by issues of mental health
                or illness.   Let's open up and eliminate stigma against mental illness.  If you see a diary at any of our campuses - 
                Burnaby, Vancouver, or Surrey - share your story, pass on the diary, and keep it safe.  
                This is our book to remind all of us that we are not as alone as we may think.

            <p>Please note that these stories are public and some of them will be transcribed and become a part of the initiative
               on our website. (If you prefer not to have your story published online, please put a star next to your last sentence).
               </p>
